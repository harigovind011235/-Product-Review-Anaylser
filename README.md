# -Product-Review-Anaylser
this is a text analyser intended to check whether its a positive or negative text from scale -1 to 1.
 
 1 => i gave the 'url' of a random online news to the variable url.
 2 => created a object Article using the module newspaper on a variable 'article'.
 3 => performed some functions on article that is downloading it,parsing it and prepared it natural language processing.
 4 => by using article.summary it created a whole summary of the article containing important information and stored it on a
 varible text.
 5 => created a variable named 'blob' and passed the string information from the text to it.
 6 => have used the method sentiment and polarity to find the context like whether its a positive or a negative text from scale to -1 to 1.
 
 7=> i have given two examples first url contains a negative news and the second url contains a positive news and you can see that the output is entirely different still not accurate though.but we can use it to analyse some obvious or easy lines like a product review on e-commerce sites and find the average of all reviews to get the basic idea about the client response for futher marketing.
